# About EquitX

## What is EquitX?
EquitX is a decentralized investment platform designed to democratize access to the small-cap equity market. Utilizing blockchain technology, EquitX enables investors to participate in the financial growth of small-cap companies through synthetic assets called eStocks. These eStocks represent shares in the underlying assets, allowing users to invest in businesses that are typically out of reach due to high volatility, lower liquidity, and limited market exposure.


## Why Stellar?
We chose Stellar as the foundation for EquitX due to its unique strengths in handling financial applications, particularly those requiring high throughput and low-cost transactions. Stellar's consensus protocol is designed for speed and efficiency, ensuring that EquitX operations are both swift and economical. This aligns perfectly with our mission to make small-cap investments accessible to a broader audience. Additionally, Stellar's built-in compliance features support our commitment to regulatory adherence, which is crucial for fostering trust and safety in financial transactions. With its growing ecosystem and focus on expanding financial access, Stellar provides the ideal infrastructure to support our innovative investment solutions.

## What are eStocks?
**Overview**

At EquitX, we introduce eStocks as a novel form of synthetic assets that provide exposure to small-cap equities. Unlike traditional assets, eStocks are not direct investments in stocks but are derivatives that track the performance of real-world assets through sophisticated smart contracts and real-time data provided by Oracles.

**Availability of eStocks**
Upon launch, EquitX will offer a variety of eStocks representing different sectors and industries, allowing investors to diversify their portfolios and access markets previously difficult to penetrate.

**Types of Assets for eStocks**
EquitX can transform any asset with a public price into an eStock, expanding the possibilities for investment. Our community-driven approach allows users to propose new eStocks, fostering a dynamic and responsive investment environment.


## How to Use EquitX

3. Select your desired collateral ratio to determine the quantity of eStocks you can mint.
