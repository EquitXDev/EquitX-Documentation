# Governance

## What is the EQTX Token?
The EQTX token is a native asset on the Stellar blockchain, integral to the EquitX ecosystem. It serves as the utility token within our platform, facilitating governance through on-chain voting on Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) proposals. Ownership of EQTX tokens empowers users with decision-making abilities on key platform developments and policy changes.

The total supply of EQTX is capped, ensuring a fixed and unchangeable quantity to uphold the token's value and integrity. In line with our commitment to fairness and transparency, EquitX has foregone any pre-sale or private allocations of EQTX tokens, ensuring a level playing field for all participants from the start.

## How to Vote On-Chain?
To engage in the governance of EquitX:
1. **Acquire EQTX Tokens:** You must first own EQTX tokens which can be bought on the open market or earned through participation in various platform activities such as liquidity provision or as rewards from Stability Pools.
2. **Stake Your EQTX Tokens:** To vote on proposals, your EQTX tokens need to be staked in the protocol. The amount of EQTX you stake determines your voting power. For example, staking 100 EQTX would mean 100 votes in your favor for any proposal you choose to support.
3. **Participate in Voting:** Once you have staked your EQTX, you can vote on proposals during active voting periods. Your staked EQTX are locked and cannot be transferred or unstaked until the voting period concludes, ensuring commitment and stability in decision-making.

## Can I Change My Vote?
Currently, once cast, votes cannot be changed. This policy ensures that voting decisions are deliberate and considered, reducing the potential for volatility in governance decisions. However, we are open to evolving our governance processes and may consider enabling vote changes in future protocol updates based on community feedback and technological advancements.

Through the EQTX token and our governance model, EquitX aims to foster a community-driven approach where all stakeholders have a voice in shaping the platformâ€™s future. This democratic model not only enhances transparency and trust but also aligns with our vision of creating a decentralized and user-centric investment ecosystem.
