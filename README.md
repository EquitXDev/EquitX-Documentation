# EquitX-Documentation

**Welcome to EquitX**

EquitX is an innovative decentralized platform designed to transform the way individuals and businesses invest in small-cap companies. Utilizing the power of blockchain technology, specifically built on Stellar, EquitX provides a secure, transparent, and accessible way to invest in the potential growth of small-cap equities through synthetic assets known as eStocks. Our platform is crafted to lower the barriers to entry for investment opportunities that have traditionally been out of reach for most investors due to high volatility, lower liquidity, and limited visibility.

EquitX is more than just an investment platform—it's a community-driven ecosystem where every user can have a voice and influence the future of investment in small-cap equities. Through the use of our native token, EQTX, users can participate in governance decisions, contributing to the continuous evolution and improvement of EquitX.
